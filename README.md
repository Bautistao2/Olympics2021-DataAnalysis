## **📈 Database Details**

### **Tables Created**
1. **`Athletes`**:
   - Columns: `PersonName`, `Country`, `Discipline`
   - Description: Contains information about the athletes and their disciplines.

2. **`Coaches`**:
   - Columns: `Name`, `Country`, `Discipline`, `Event`
   - Description: Contains information about the coaches.

3. **`EntriesGender`**:
   - Columns: `Discipline`, `Female`, `Male`, `Total`
   - Description: Records the number of entries by gender in each discipline.

4. **`Medals`**:
   - Columns: `Rank`, `TeamCountry`, `Gold`, `Silver`, `Bronze`, `Total`, `Rank_by_Total`
   - Description: Tracks medal counts for each country.

5. **`Teams`**:
   - Columns: `TeamName`, `Discipline`, `Country`, `Event`
   - Description: Contains information about the teams and events.

### **SQL Scripts**
- **`create_table.sql`**: Defines the schema for the above tables.
- **`queries.sql`**: Includes advanced SQL queries for insights such as:
  - 🏅 Countries with the most medals.
  - 🎈 Distribution of medals by type.
  - 🏋️ Countries participating in the highest number of disciplines.
  - 🏊 Most competitive sports (sports with the highest number of participating countries).

---

## **📚 Data Loading**
The `load_data.py` script loads data from the raw CSV files into the SQLite database. Steps:
1. Define the path to the dataset.
2. Load the data into a relational SQLite database.
3. Create tables as per the schema defined in `create_tables.sql`.

---

## **🔬 Data Analysis**
The `analysis.py` script executes advanced SQL queries to extract insights and saves the results as CSV files in the `output/` directory.

### **Advanced Queries**
Examples of SQL queries included:
1. **Top Countries by Total Medals**:
   ```sql
   SELECT TeamCountry, SUM(Gold + Silver + Bronze) AS TotalMedals
   FROM Medals
   GROUP BY TeamCountry
   ORDER BY TotalMedals DESC
   LIMIT 10;
   ```

2. **Distribution of Medal Types**:
   ```sql
   SELECT SUM(Gold) AS TotalGold, SUM(Silver) AS TotalSilver, SUM(Bronze) AS TotalBronze
   FROM Medals;
   ```

3. **Countries Participating in the Most Disciplines**:
   ```sql
   SELECT Country, COUNT(DISTINCT Discipline) AS TotalDisciplines
   FROM Teams
   GROUP BY Country
   ORDER BY TotalDisciplines DESC
   LIMIT 10;
   ```

## **🎨 Visualizations**
The `visualizations.py` script generates plots to visually represent the data and analysis results.

### **Generated Visualizations**
1. **🏅 Top 10 Countries by Total Medals**:
   - ![Bar chart showing the countries with the highest medal counts.](plots/top_countries_by_medals.png)
   - Saved as `plots/top_countries_by_medals.png`.

2. **🎈 Medal Type Distribution**:
   - ![Pie chart showing the overall distribution of gold, silver, and bronze medals.](plots/medal_type_distribution.png)
   - Saved as `plots/medal_type_distribution.png`.

3. **🏋️ Countries with the Most Disciplines**:
   - ![Bar chart showing the countries participating in the highest number of unique disciplines.](plots/countries_with_most_disciplines.png)
   - Saved as `plots/countries_with_most_disciplines.png`.

4. **🏊 Most Competitive Sports**:
   - ![Bar chart showing sports with the highest number of participating countries.](plots/countries_with_most_sports.png)
   - Saved as `plots/countries_with_most_sports.png`.
